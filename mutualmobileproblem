Problem Statement
===============

Write a web service which takes a date and time parameter and returns a list of restaurants which are open on that date and time. Optimized solutions are nice, but correct solutions are more important!

The restaurants with open time are available using the following API

Either call the API or just download the content into a file and use it.

If a day of the week is not listed, the restaurant is closed on that day

All times are local — don’t worry about timezone-awareness

 

Minimum Requirement

Create an API which accepts a date and time and returns the open restaurants

 

Plus Points A

Implement a search API to search restaurants dynamically by Text.

Create an API which accepts a sort parameter and returns the list of  restaurants with the nearest closing time or by title.

 

Plus Points B

Use any of one [Nest / Hapi / Loopback / Sail]

Production level Code; Beautify; Comment; Documented code; handle Input Exceptions, Unicode and Null values.

Use of proper design patterns and data structures

Write unit tests to test the business logic.

Awesome if your test coverage exceeds about 50%
